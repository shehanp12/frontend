You can also call\n *                 <code>SplitShard</code> to increase stream capacity, so that more Kinesis Data\n *             Streams applications can simultaneously read data from the stream for real-time\n *             processing. </p>\n *         <p>You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the position\n *             in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the new hash key might be\n *             the average of the beginning and ending hash key, but it can be any hash key value in\n *             the range being mapped into the shard.

Upon receiving a\n *                 <code>SplitShard</code> request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response\n *             and sets the stream status to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the operation is completed,\n *             Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Read and write\n *             operations continue to work while the stream is in the <code>UPDATING</code> state. </p>\n *         <p>You can use <code>DescribeStream</code> to check the status of the stream, which is\n *             returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>. If the stream is in the <code>ACTIVE</code>\n *             state, you can call <code>SplitShard</code>. If a stream is in <code>CREATING</code> or\n *                 <code>UPDATING</code> or <code>DELETING</code> states, <code>DescribeStream</code>\n *             returns a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>.</p>\n *         <p>If the specified stream does not exist, <code>DescribeStream</code> returns a\n *                 <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>.

shards in the Kinesis data stream, to increase the\n *             stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. <code>SplitShard</code> is called when\n *             there is a need to increase the overall capacity of a stream because of an expected\n *             increase in the volume of data records being ingested. </p>\n *         <p>You can also use <code>SplitShard</code> when a shard appears to be approaching its\n *             maximum utilization; for example, the producers sending data into the specific shard are\n *             suddenly sending more than previously anticipated. You can also call\n *                 <code>SplitShard</code> to increase stream capacity, so that more Kinesis Data\n *             Streams applications can simultaneously read data from the stream for real-time\n *             processing. </p>\n *         <p>You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the position\n *             in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the new hash key might be\n *             the average of the beginning and ending hash key, but it can be any hash key value in\n *             the range being mapped into the shard. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-split.html\">Split a\n *                 Shard</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer\n *                 Guide</i>.</p>\n *         <p>You can use <a>DescribeStream</a> to determine the shard ID and hash key\n *             values for the <code>ShardToSplit</code> and <code>NewStartingHashKey</code> parameters\n *             that are specified in the <code>SplitShard</code> request.</p>\n *         <p>\n *             <code>SplitShard</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a\n *                 <code>SplitShard</code> request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response\n *             and sets the stream status to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the operation is completed,\n *             Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Read and write\n *             operations continue to work while the stream is in the <code>UPDATING</code> state. </p>\n *         <p>You can use <code>DescribeStream</code> to check the status of the stream, which is\n *             returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>. If the stream is in the <code>ACTIVE</code>\n *             state, you can call <code>SplitShard</code>. If a stream is in <code>CREATING</code> or\n *                 <code>UPDATING</code> or <code>DELETING</code> states, <code>DescribeStream</code>\n *             returns a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>.</p>\n *         <p>If the specified stream does not exist, <code>DescribeStream</code> returns a\n *                 <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>. If you try to create more shards than are\n *             authorized for your account, you receive a <code>LimitExceededException</code>. </p>\n *         <p>For the default shard limit for an AWS account, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html\">Kinesis Data Streams\n *                 Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer\n *                 Guide</i>.
