The initial status of the\n *          delivery stream is <code>CREATING</code>. After the delivery stream is created, its status\n *          is <code>ACTIVE</code> and it now accepts data. If the delivery stream creation fails, the\n *          status transitions to <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>. Attempts to send data to a delivery\n *          stream that is not in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state cause an exception. To check the state\n *          of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>.</p>\n *          <p>If the status of a delivery stream is <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, this status\n *          doesn't change, and you can't invoke <code>CreateDeliveryStream</code> again on it.\n *          However, you can invoke the <a>DeleteDeliveryStream</a> operation to delete\n *          it.</p>\n *          <p>A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to receive records directly\n *          from providers using <a>PutRecord</a> or <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, or it\n *          can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To specify a Kinesis\n *          data stream as input, set the <code>DeliveryStreamType</code> parameter to\n *             <code>KinesisStreamAsSource</code>, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name\n *          (ARN) and role ARN in the <code>KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration</code>\n *          parameter.</p>\n *          <p>To create a delivery stream with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled, include <a>DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput</a> in your request. This is\n *          optional. You can also invoke <a>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</a> to turn on\n *          SSE for an existing delivery stream that doesn't have SSE enabled.</p>\n *          <p>A delivery stream is configured with a single destination: Amazon S3, Amazon ES,\n *          Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You must specify only one of the following destination\n *          configuration parameters: <code>ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration</code>,\n *             <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>,\n *             <code>ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration</code>,\n *             <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration</code>, or\n *             <code>SplunkDestinationConfiguration</code>.</p>\n *          <p>When you specify <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, you can also provide the\n *          following optional values: BufferingHints, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>, and\n *             <code>CompressionFormat</code>. By default, if no <code>BufferingHints</code> value is\n *          provided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever\n *          condition is satisfied first. <code>BufferingHints</code> is a hint, so there are some\n *          cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record\n *          boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or under the configured buffering\n *          size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable\n *          encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3.</p>\n *\n *          <p>A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination:</p>\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location.\n *                Kinesis Data Firehose first delivers data to Amazon S3 and then uses\n *                   <code>COPY</code> syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table.

to 50 delivery streams per AWS Region.</p>\n *          <p>This is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns. The initial status of the\n *          delivery stream is <code>CREATING</code>. After the delivery stream is created, its status\n *          is <code>ACTIVE</code> and it now accepts data. If the delivery stream creation fails, the\n *          status transitions to <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>. Attempts to send data to a delivery\n *          stream that is not in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state cause an exception. To check the state\n *          of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>.</p>\n *          <p>If the status of a delivery stream is <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, this status\n *          doesn't change, and you can't invoke <code>CreateDeliveryStream</code> again on it.\n *          However, you can invoke the <a>DeleteDeliveryStream</a> operation to delete\n *          it.</p>\n *          <p>A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to receive records directly\n *          from providers using <a>PutRecord</a> or <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, or it\n *          can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To specify a Kinesis\n *          data stream as input, set the <code>DeliveryStreamType</code> parameter to\n *             <code>KinesisStreamAsSource</code>, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name\n *          (ARN) and role ARN in the <code>KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration</code>\n *          parameter.</p>\n *          <p>To create a delivery stream with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled, include <a>DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput</a> in your request. This is\n *          optional. You can also invoke <a>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</a> to turn on\n *          SSE for an existing delivery stream that doesn't have SSE enabled.</p>\n *          <p>A delivery stream is configured with a single destination: Amazon S3, Amazon ES,\n *          Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You must specify only one of the following destination\n *          configuration parameters: <code>ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration</code>,\n *             <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>,\n *             <code>ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration</code>,\n *             <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration</code>, or\n *             <code>SplunkDestinationConfiguration</code>.</p>\n *          <p>When you specify <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, you can also provide the\n *          following optional values: BufferingHints, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>, and\n *             <code>CompressionFormat</code>. By default, if no <code>BufferingHints</code> value is\n *          provided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever\n *          condition is satisfied first. <code>BufferingHints</code> is a hint, so there are some\n *          cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record\n *          boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or under the configured buffering\n *          size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable\n *          encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3.</p>\n *\n *          <p>A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination:</p>\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location.\n *                Kinesis Data Firehose first delivers data to Amazon S3 and then uses\n *                   <code>COPY</code> syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table. This is\n *                specified in the <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code>\n *                parameter.</p>\n *\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>The compression formats <code>SNAPPY</code> or <code>ZIP</code> cannot be\n *                specified in <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> because\n *                the Amazon Redshift <code>COPY</code> operation that reads from the S3 bucket doesn't\n *                support these compression formats.</p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p>We strongly recommend that you use the user name and password you provide\n *                exclusively with Kinesis Data Firehose, and that the permissions for the account are\n *                restricted for Amazon Redshift <code>INSERT</code> permissions.</p>\n *\n *             </li>\n *          </ul>\n *          <p>Kinesis Data Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of the\n *          destination.
