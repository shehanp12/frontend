<p>Compares a face in the <i>source</i> input image with\n *       each of the 100 largest faces detected in the <i>target</i> input image.\n *     </p>\n *          <note>\n *             <p> If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face\n *         and compares it with each face detected in the target image. </p>\n *          </note>\n *\n *\n *          <p>You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as\n *       references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the\n *       AWS\n *       CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't\n *       supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. </p>\n *          <p>In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score\n *       in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face,\n *       facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and\n *       confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face).\n *       The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. </p>\n *\n *          <note>\n *             <p>By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are\n *         returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the\n *           <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.</p>\n *          </note>\n *\n *          <p>\n *             <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image.\n *       For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality.\n *     The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box\n *       of the face and confidence value.</p>\n *\n *          <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces\n *       that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a\n *       variety of common use cases.  Use <code>QualityFilter</code> to set the quality bar\n *       by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>.\n *       If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. </p>\n *\n *          <p>If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns orientation information for the\n *         source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.</p>\n *          <p>If no faces are detected in the source or target images, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an\n *     <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. </p>\n *\n *\n *          <note>\n *             <p> This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.</p>\n *          </note>\n *\n *\n *          <p>For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p>\n *          <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CompareFaces</code>\n *       action.</p>\n */\nexport class CompareFacesCommand extends $Command<\n  CompareFacesCommandInput,\n  CompareFacesCommandOutput,\n  RekognitionClientResolvedConfig\n> {\n  // Start section: command_properties\n  // End section: command_properties\n\n  constructor(readonly input: CompareFacesCommandInput) {\n    // Start section: command_constructor\n    super();\n    // End section: command_constructor\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @internal\n   */\n  resolveMiddleware(\n    clientStack: MiddlewareStack<ServiceInputTypes, ServiceOutputTypes>,\n    configuration: RekognitionClientResolvedConfig,\n    options?: __HttpHandlerOptions\n  ): Handler<CompareFacesCommandInput, CompareFacesCommandOutput> {\n    this.middlewareStack.use(getSerdePlugin(configuration, this.serialize, this.deserialize));\n\n    const stack = clientStack.concat(this.middlewareStack);\n\n    const { logger } = configuration;\n    const clientName = \"RekognitionClient\";\n    const commandName = \"CompareFacesCommand\";\n    const handlerExecutionContext: HandlerExecutionContext = {\n      logger,\n      clientName,\n      commandName,\n      inputFilterSensitiveLog: CompareFacesRequest.filterSensitiveLog,\n      outputFilterSensitiveLog: CompareFacesResponse.filterSensitiveLog,\n    };\n    const { requestHandler } = configuration;\n    return stack.resolve(\n      (request: FinalizeHandlerArguments<any>) =>\n        requestHandler.handle(request.request as __HttpRequest, options || {}),\n      handlerExecutionContext\n    );\n  }\n\n  private serialize(input: CompareFacesCommandInput, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<__HttpRequest> {\n    return serializeAws_json1_1CompareFacesCommand(input, context);\n  }\n\n  private deserialize(output: __HttpResponse, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<CompareFacesCommandOutput> {\n    return deserializeAws_json1_1CompareFacesCommand(output, context);\n  }\n\n  // Start section: command_body_extra\n  // End section: command_body_extra\n}\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"a8bc3dfd970da41a3d0436a45f87ea9c","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
