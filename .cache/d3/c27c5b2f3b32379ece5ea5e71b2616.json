The shard\n *             iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data\n *             records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that\n *             the iterator points to, <a>GetRecords</a> returns an empty list. It might\n *             take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records.</p>\n *         <p>You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service\n *             limits (for more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html\">Amazon Kinesis Data Streams\n *                 Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer\n *                 Guide</i>). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading\n *             continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the\n *             shard iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a> call. <a>GetRecords</a> returns a new shard iterator in\n *                 <code>NextShardIterator</code>. Specify the shard iterator returned in\n *                 <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent calls to <a>GetRecords</a>.\n *             If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.\n *             You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches\n *             the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record\n *             to process.</p>\n *         <p>Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB\n *             per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or\n *             throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to specify the maximum number of\n *             records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return. Consider your average record size\n *             when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call\n *             is 10,000.</p>\n *\n *         <p>The size of the data returned by <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on\n *             the utilization of the shard. The maximum size of data that <a>GetRecords</a>\n *             can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made\n *             within the next 5 seconds throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If\n *             there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within\n *             the next 1 second throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <a>GetRecords</a> doesn't return any data when it throws an exception. For this\n *             reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. However, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1\n *             second.</p>\n *         <p>To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the\n *                 <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute. You can also monitor the stream\n *             using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html\">Monitoring</a> in the <i>Amazon\n *                 Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).</p>\n *         <p>Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value,\n *                 <code>ApproximateArrivalTimestamp</code>, that is set when a stream successfully\n *             receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp,\n *             whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record\n *             to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for\n *             example with <a>PutRecords</a>). The time stamp has millisecond precision.\n *             There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always\n *             increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps\n *             that are out of order.</p>\n *         <p>This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per shard.</p>\n */\nvar GetRecordsCommand = function (_super) {\n  (0, _tslib.__extends)(GetRecordsCommand, _super); // Start section: command_properties\n  // End section: command_properties\n\n

It might\n *             take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records.</p>\n *         <p>You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service\n *             limits (for more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html\">Amazon Kinesis Data Streams\n *                 Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer\n *                 Guide</i>). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading\n *             continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the\n *             shard iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a> call. <a>GetRecords</a> returns a new shard iterator in\n *                 <code>NextShardIterator</code>. Specify the shard iterator returned in\n *                 <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent calls to <a>GetRecords</a>.\n *             If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in <code>NextShardIterator</code>.\n *             You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches\n *             the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record\n *             to process.</p>\n *         <p>Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB\n *             per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or\n *             throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to specify the maximum number of\n *             records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return. Consider your average record size\n *             when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call\n *             is 10,000.</p>\n *\n *         <p>The size of the data returned by <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on\n *             the utilization of the shard. The maximum size of data that <a>GetRecords</a>\n *             can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made\n *             within the next 5 seconds throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If\n *             there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within\n *             the next 1 second throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <a>GetRecords</a> doesn't return any data when it throws an exception. For this\n *             reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. However, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1\n *             second.</p>\n *         <p>To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the\n *                 <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute. You can also monitor the stream\n *             using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html\">Monitoring</a> in the <i>Amazon\n *                 Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).</p>\n *         <p>Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value,\n *                 <code>ApproximateArrivalTimestamp</code>, that is set when a stream successfully\n *             receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp,\n *             whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record\n *             to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for\n *             example with <a>PutRecords</a>). The time stamp has millisecond precision.\n *             There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always\n *             increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps\n *             that are out of order.</p>\n *         <p>This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per shard.</p>\n */\nexport class GetRecordsCommand extends $Command<\n  GetRecordsCommandInput,\n  GetRecordsCommandOutput,\n  KinesisClientResolvedConfig\n> {\n  // Start section: command_properties\n  // End section: command_properties\n\n  constructor(readonly input: GetRecordsCommandInput) {\n    // Start section: command_constructor\n    super();\n    // End section: command_constructor\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @internal\n   */\n  resolveMiddleware(\n    clientStack: MiddlewareStack<ServiceInputTypes, ServiceOutputTypes>,\n    configuration: KinesisClientResolvedConfig,\n    options?: __HttpHandlerOptions\n  ): Handler<GetRecordsCommandInput, GetRecordsCommandOutput> {\n    this.middlewareStack.use(getSerdePlugin(configuration, this.serialize, this.deserialize));\n\n    const stack = clientStack.concat(this.middlewareStack);\n\n    const { logger } = configuration;\n    const clientName = \"KinesisClient\";\n    const commandName = \"GetRecordsCommand\";\n    const handlerExecutionContext: HandlerExecutionContext = {\n      logger,\n      clientName,\n      commandName,\n      inputFilterSensitiveLog: GetRecordsInput.filterSensitiveLog,\n      outputFilterSensitiveLog: GetRecordsOutput.filterSensitiveLog,\n    };\n    const { requestHandler } = configuration;\n    return stack.resolve(\n      (request: FinalizeHandlerArguments<any>) =>\n        requestHandler.handle(request.request as __HttpRequest, options || {}),\n      handlerExecutionContext\n    );\n  }\n\n  private serialize(input: GetRecordsCommandInput, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<__HttpRequest> {\n    return serializeAws_json1_1GetRecordsCommand(input, context);\n  }\n\n  private deserialize(output: __HttpResponse, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<GetRecordsCommandOutput> {\n    return deserializeAws_json1_1GetRecordsCommand(output, context);\n  }\n\n  // Start section: command_body_extra\n  // End section: command_body_extra\n}\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"ee7a88f7dce50b280150d327de27a84f","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
