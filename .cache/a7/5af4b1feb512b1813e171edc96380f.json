Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort\n *          operation and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload.

You initiate\n *          a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the\n *          multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special\n *          about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html\">Authenticating\n *             Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)</a>.</p>\n *\n *          <note>\n *             <p> After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being\n *             charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart\n *             upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for\n *             storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload. </p>\n *          </note>\n *\n *          <p>You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3\n *          encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you\n *          access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS\n *          KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide\n *          your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in <a href=\"AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html\">UploadPart</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html\">UploadPartCopy</a> requests must match the headers you used in the request to\n *          initiate the upload by using <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>. </p>\n *          <p>To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must\n *          have permission to the <code>kms:Encrypt</code>, <code>kms:Decrypt</code>,\n *             <code>kms:ReEncrypt*</code>, <code>kms:GenerateDataKey*</code>, and\n *             <code>kms:DescribeKey</code> actions on the key. These permissions are required because\n *          Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the\n *          multipart upload.</p>\n *\n *          <p>If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account\n *          as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy.

Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts\n *                   your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you\n *                   access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed\n *                   encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. </p>\n *                <ul>\n *                   <li>\n *                      <p>Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored\n *                         in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys\n *                         used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.</p>\n *                      <ul>\n *                         <li>\n *                            <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption</p>\n *                         </li>\n *                         <li>\n *                            <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</p>\n *                         </li>\n *                         <li>\n *                            <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</p>\n *                         </li>\n *                      </ul>\n *                      <note>\n *                         <p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but\n *                            don't provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>,\n *                            Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.</p>\n *                      </note>\n *                      <important>\n *                         <p>All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if\n *                            you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.</p>\n *                      </important>\n *                      <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS\n *                         KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS\n *                            KMS</a>.</p>\n *                   </li>\n *                   <li>\n *                      <p>Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own\n *                         encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.</p>\n *                      <ul>\n *                         <li>\n *                            <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm</p>\n *                         </li>\n *                         <li>\n *                            <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key</p>\n *                         </li>\n *                         <li>\n *                            <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5</p>\n *                         </li>\n *                      </ul>\n *                      <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS\n *                         KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS\n *                            KMS</a>.</p>\n *                   </li>\n *                </ul>\n *             </dd>\n *             <dt>Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</dt>\n *             <dd>\n *                <p>You also can use the following access control–related headers with this\n *                   operation.
