Clients use this API to send text and audio\n *       requests to Amazon Lex at runtime. Amazon Lex interprets the user input using the machine learning model\n *       that it built for the bot. </p>\n *          <p>The <code>PostContent</code> operation supports audio input at 8kHz and 16kHz. You can use\n *       8kHz audio to achieve higher speech recognition accuracy in telephone audio applications. </p>\n *          <p> In response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the user. Consider the following\n *       example messages: </p>\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p> For a user input \"I would like a pizza,\" Amazon Lex might return a response with a message\n *           eliciting slot data (for example, <code>PizzaSize</code>): \"What size pizza would you\n *           like?\". </p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p> After the user provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon Lex might return a\n *           response with a message to get user confirmation: \"Order the pizza?\". </p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p> After the user replies \"Yes\" to the confirmation prompt, Amazon Lex might return a\n *           conclusion statement: \"Thank you, your cheese pizza has been ordered.\". </p>\n *             </li>\n *          </ul>\n *          <p> Not all Amazon Lex messages require a response from the user. For example, conclusion\n *       statements do not require a response. Some messages require only a yes or no response. In\n *       addition to the <code>message</code>, Amazon Lex provides additional context about the message in\n *       the response that you can use to enhance client behavior, such as displaying the appropriate\n *       client user interface. Consider the following examples: </p>\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p> If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the following context\n *

to Amazon Lex. Clients use this API to send text and audio\n *       requests to Amazon Lex at runtime. Amazon Lex interprets the user input using the machine learning model\n *       that it built for the bot. </p>\n *          <p>The <code>PostContent</code> operation supports audio input at 8kHz and 16kHz. You can use\n *       8kHz audio to achieve higher speech recognition accuracy in telephone audio applications. </p>\n *          <p> In response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the user. Consider the following\n *       example messages: </p>\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p> For a user input \"I would like a pizza,\" Amazon Lex might return a response with a message\n *           eliciting slot data (for example, <code>PizzaSize</code>): \"What size pizza would you\n *           like?\". </p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p> After the user provides all of the pizza order information, Amazon Lex might return a\n *           response with a message to get user confirmation: \"Order the pizza?\". </p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p> After the user replies \"Yes\" to the confirmation prompt, Amazon Lex might return a\n *           conclusion statement: \"Thank you, your cheese pizza has been ordered.\". </p>\n *             </li>\n *          </ul>\n *          <p> Not all Amazon Lex messages require a response from the user. For example, conclusion\n *       statements do not require a response. Some messages require only a yes or no response. In\n *       addition to the <code>message</code>, Amazon Lex provides additional context about the message in\n *       the response that you can use to enhance client behavior, such as displaying the appropriate\n *       client user interface. Consider the following examples: </p>\n *          <ul>\n *             <li>\n *                <p> If the message is to elicit slot data, Amazon Lex returns the following context\n *           information: </p>\n *                <ul>\n *                   <li>\n *                      <p>\n *                         <code>x-amz-lex-dialog-state</code> header set to <code>ElicitSlot</code>\n *                      </p>\n *                   </li>\n *                   <li>\n *                      <p>\n *                         <code>x-amz-lex-intent-name</code> header set to the intent name in the current\n *               context </p>\n *                   </li>\n *                   <li>\n *                      <p>\n *                         <code>x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit</code> header set to the slot name for which the\n *                 <code>message</code> is eliciting information </p>\n *                   </li>\n *                   <li>\n *                      <p>\n *                         <code>x-amz-lex-slots</code> header set to a map of slots configured for the intent\n *               with their current values </p>\n *                   </li>\n *                </ul>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p> If the message is a confirmation prompt, the <code>x-amz-lex-dialog-state</code>\n *           header is set to <code>Confirmation</code> and the <code>x-amz-lex-slot-to-elicit</code>\n *           header is omitted. </p>\n *             </li>\n *             <li>\n *                <p> If the message is a clarification prompt configured for the intent, indicating that\n *           the user intent is not understood, the <code>x-amz-dialog-state</code> header is set to\n *             <code>ElicitIntent</code> and the <code>x-amz-slot-to-elicit</code> header is omitted.\n *         </p>\n *             </li>\n *          </ul>\n *          <p> In addition, Amazon Lex also returns your application-specific <code>sessionAttributes</code>.\n *       For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/context-mgmt.html\">Managing Conversation Context</a>. </p>\n */\nexport class PostContentCommand extends $Command<\n  PostContentCommandInput,\n  PostContentCommandOutput,\n  LexRuntimeServiceClientResolvedConfig\n> {\n  // Start section: command_properties\n  // End section: command_properties\n\n  constructor(readonly input: PostContentCommandInput) {\n    // Start section: command_constructor\n    super();\n    // End section: command_constructor\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @internal\n   */\n  resolveMiddleware(\n    clientStack: MiddlewareStack<ServiceInputTypes, ServiceOutputTypes>,\n    configuration: LexRuntimeServiceClientResolvedConfig,\n    options?: __HttpHandlerOptions\n  ): Handler<PostContentCommandInput, PostContentCommandOutput> {\n    this.middlewareStack.use(getSerdePlugin(configuration, this.serialize, this.deserialize));\n\n    const stack = clientStack.concat(this.middlewareStack);\n\n    const { logger } = configuration;\n    const clientName = \"LexRuntimeServiceClient\";\n    const commandName = \"PostContentCommand\";\n    const handlerExecutionContext: HandlerExecutionContext = {\n      logger,\n      clientName,\n      commandName,\n      inputFilterSensitiveLog: PostContentRequest.filterSensitiveLog,\n      outputFilterSensitiveLog: PostContentResponse.filterSensitiveLog,\n    };\n    const { requestHandler } = configuration;\n    return stack.resolve(\n      (request: FinalizeHandlerArguments<any>) =>\n        requestHandler.handle(request.request as __HttpRequest, options || {}),\n      handlerExecutionContext\n    );\n  }\n\n  private serialize(input: PostContentCommandInput, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<__HttpRequest> {\n    return serializeAws_restJson1PostContentCommand(input, context);\n  }\n\n  private deserialize(output: __HttpResponse, context: __SerdeContext): Promise<PostContentCommandOutput> {\n    return deserializeAws_restJson1PostContentCommand(output, context);\n  }\n\n  // Start section: command_body_extra\n  // End section: command_body_extra\n}\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"abf904b77a0f6c62c8b4b818956b0794","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
